1. Executed result as below:

?- solve(T,W,O,F,U,R).
T = 7,
W = 6,
O = 5,
F = 1,
U = 3,
R = 0 .

?- solve(S,E,N,D,T,H,M,O,Y).
S = 9,
E = 6,
N = 3,
D = 8,
T = 7,
H = 2,
M = 1,
O = 0,
Y = 4 .

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

2. Executed result as below:

?- solve.
(monday ,mango ,peanuts)
(tuesday ,apple ,cashews)
(wednesday ,apricot ,almonds)
(thursday ,banana ,walnuts)
(friday ,pear ,pecans)
true .

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

3. The easiest part is to understand the logical requirements of the assignment.

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

4. The hardest part is to truly understand how Prolog works (this is really difficult!), think through how to construct clauses and functions to evaluate the requirements and debug over the functions.
